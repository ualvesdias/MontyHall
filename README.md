# The Python Script
This is a simple proof of the math behind the Monty Hall problem... The script simulates 100,000 different games and computes the win rate. When the player do not change doors, he keeps its 33.33% chance of winning. On the other hand, when he changes doors, the odds change to 66.67% in his favor. And this is what the script shows.

# Instructions
Alter the value of the variable "change" to True of False to simulate the decision made by the player: keeping the original door (change = False) or change doors after the host revealed a "GOAT" (change = True).
